# FastApiElasticSearch
Integration guide based on phind output


To create a FastAPI route that uses the AsyncElasticsearch client, we can use dependency injection to inject the client as a dependency. Here's how to do it:

1. First, we need to install the required libraries. We need the `elasticsearch` library for the Elasticsearch client and the `fastapi` library for the web framework. We can install them using pip:

   ```
   pip install elasticsearch fastapi
   ```

2. Next, we need to create an instance of the AsyncElasticsearch client and add it as a dependency to our FastAPI app. Here's an example:

   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
   from elasticsearch import AsyncElasticsearch

   app = FastAPI()

   async def get_es_client():
       es_client = AsyncElasticsearch(hosts=["localhost"])
       yield es_client
       await es_client.close()

   @app.get("/")
   async def root(es_client: AsyncElasticsearch = Depends(get_es_client)):
       # Use the Elasticsearch client to perform a search
       result = await es_client.search(index="my-index", body={"query": {"match_all": {}}})
       return result
   ```

   In this example, we define a function `get_es_client` that creates an instance of the AsyncElasticsearch client and yields it as a dependency. We also define a FastAPI route that depends on the Elasticsearch client. When the route is called, FastAPI will inject the Elasticsearch client as a dependency.

   Note that we use the `yield` keyword instead of `return` in `get_es_client`. This is because we want to keep the Elasticsearch client open for the duration of the request. When the request is finished, FastAPI will call `await es_client.close()` to close the client.

   We also specify the `hosts` parameter when creating the Elasticsearch client. This tells the client where to connect to. In this example, we connect to a local Elasticsearch instance.

3. To test the route, we can start the FastAPI app using `uvicorn`:

   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   This will start the app and automatically reload it whenever we make changes to the code.

4. We can now make a request to the route using a web browser or a tool like `curl`. The response should be a JSON object containing the results of the Elasticsearch search.

   ```
   $ curl http://localhost:8000/
   {"took": 1, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {...}}
   ```

   Note that we didn't specify the `index` or `body` parameters when calling the `search` method. This is because they are already specified in the route definition. If we want to perform a different search, we can modify the `body` parameter in the route definition.

   ```python
   @app.get("/")
   async def root(es_client: AsyncElasticsearch = Depends(get_es_client)):
       # Use the Elasticsearch client to perform a search
       result = await es_client.search(index="my-other-index", body={"query": {"match_all": {}}})
       return result
   ```

   This will perform a search on the `my-other-index` index instead of the `my-index` index.
